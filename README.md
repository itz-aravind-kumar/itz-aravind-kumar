# Hi 👋, I'm Aravind Kumar Muddana

### Backend Engineer | System Design Enthusiast | Performance & Scalability Focused

I’m a **backend-first software engineer** who loves building **real-world systems**, understanding **how things work internally**, and pushing for **performance, scalability, and clean architecture**.

I don’t just use frameworks —  
I study **what happens under the hood**.

## 🧠 What I Focus On
- ⚙️ High-performance backend systems (Spring Boot, Flask)
- 🧩 System Design (scalable, fault-tolerant architectures)
- 🚀 Deep internals: JVM, threading, event loops, async I/O
- 📊 Databases, indexing, caching, search engines
- 🧠 Strong DSA & pattern-based problem solving
